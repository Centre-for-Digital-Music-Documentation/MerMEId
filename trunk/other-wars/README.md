Here is an exist configuration file, which should be here in order to build a docker image.
In addition in order to build that you need 

1. exist.war, which has to be built from source See [../mermeid/INSTALL.html#installexist](https://rawgit.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/MerMEId/master/trunk/mermeid/INSTALL.html#installexist)
2. orbeon.war, directly available from orbeon.com See [../mermeid/INSTALL.html#inst_orbeon](https://rawgit.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/MerMEId/master/trunk/mermeid/INSTALL.html#inst_orbeon)
