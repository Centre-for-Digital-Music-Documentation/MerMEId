            <h1>Structure and scope of MerMEId documents</h1>
            <p>This page explains the overall structure of the documents that MerMEId produces.
                Since MerMEId encodes all information as <a href="http://music-encoding.org"
                    target="_blank" title="Music Encoding Initiative">MEI</a> XML, certain
                restrictions and structural restraints are imposed on the documents by the MEI
                schema, that is, the rules for the structure and content of MEI files. Even though
                the purpose of MerMEId is to enable musicologists and librarians to produce catalogs
                or other collections of musical metadata without having to know about the details of
                MEI, knowing about some of the concepts of MEI metadata may help understanding the
                software and knowing which information goes where.</p>
            <p>MEI documents basically have two main sections: metadata and the encoding of the
                actual music. MerMEId simply ignores the encoded music section and only focuses on
                the metadata part &ndash; the so-called header (incipits are an exception: They are
                located in the header and thus the only music encodings within the scope of
                MerMEId).</p>
            <h2>Main levels of description</h2>
            <p>MerMEId allows the modelling of rather complex sets of metadata describing not only
                works and their sources, but also, for instance, various versions of a work, the
                relations between works, and the individual components of a source. Information
                about a work and its sources is organized into four distinct levels of abstraction:
                Work, version, source, and item. Users familiar with the <a
                    href="https://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records"
                    title="FRBR" target="_blank">'Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records'
                    (FRBR)</a> defined by the International Federation of Library Associations and
                Institutions (IFLA) will recognize these four levels as corresponding to the
                    <i>work</i>, <i>expression</i>, <i>manifestation</i> and <i>item</i> entities of
                FRBR. </p>
            <img alt="Work description levels"
                src="../images/manual/structure_frbr.png" width="500"
             /><br />&nbsp; <p>Apart from information about the musical work and its sources,
                MerMEId can also add technical and administrative metadata as well as
                bibliographical references to your files. An overview of this type of information is
                given at the end of this page.</p>
            <p>The following description outlines the contents of MEI metadata documents created
                with MerMEId, explains the main terms and where to input/edit the information.</p>
            <h2>The structure of the work: Work, versions, and movements</h2>
            <p>The illustration gives some typical examples of information entered at work, version,
                and movement level, respectively. </p>
            <img alt="Movements"
                src="../images/manual/structure_work_versions.png"
                width="500" /><br />&nbsp; <p><span class="heading">Work:</span> At work level, only
                information regarding the musical work in all its forms is edited. This includes the
                name of the composer, a uniform title, and the work's number in a thematic
                catalogue. The main key, in contrast, is NOT an information at work level since a
                transposition of the work would normally still be regarded as a version of the same
                work, just in a different key.</p>
            <p>Work-level information is entered mainly at the <span class="work tab">Work</span>
                tab. Historical information however, such as the date and place of composition is
                edited together with other historical facts at the <span class="history tab"
                    >History</span> tab.</p>
            <p><span class="heading">Versions:</span> Any information about the music itself such as
                key and instrumentation is entered at version level to allow the description of
                versions of the same work in different keys or instrumentations, for instance.
                Versions may have specific titles like 'Revised version (1864)' or 'Version for
                string quartet' but a version title input field is available only when more than one
                version is created (add versions by clicking the <img alt="add"
                    src="../images/add.gif" /> button next to the label
                'Version'). </p>
            <p>With multi-movement works, some of this information such as key, metre, and tempo
                should obviously be entered at movement level (see below). Version information is
                entered mainly at the <span class="music tab">Music</span> tab, except for historic
                information which is edited together with other historical facts at the <span
                    class="history tab">History</span> tab. </p>
            <p>Please note that version-specific history is available only when more than one
                version is created. </p>
            <p>See also the tutorial: <a href="../manual/tutorial_versions.html"
                    title="Tutorial: Works having multiple versions">Works having multiple
                    version</a></p>
            <p><span class="heading">Movements:</span> The movements of a work are encoded as
                components of a version. They are defined at the bottom of each 'version' block at
                the <span class="music tab">Music</span> tab. MerMEId calls them 'components' rather
                than movements to emphasize that they can represent subdivisions at various levels.
                MerMEId allows up to three levels of components to be created in a tree-structured
                manner &ndash; sufficient to describe, for instance, the division of a stage work
                into acts, scenes, and numbers.</p>
            <img alt="Movements" src="../images/manual/movements.png"
                class="illustration" />
            <p>Once components are created and saved their details can be edited. These include
                roughly the same information as for versions, that is, key, tempo, metre, and
                instrumentation (which must be either the same as or a subset of the overall
                instrumentation defined at version level).</p>
            <h2>Organizing source material: Sources and items</h2>
            <p>It is important to notice that 'Source' in this context differs from what is
                perceived as a source in, for instance, a critical edition. In MerMEId, 'source' is
                the equivalent of what <a
                    href="https://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records"
                    title="FRBR" target="_blank">FRBR</a> calls a 'manifestation', as opposed to a
                specific copy ('item') of that source.</p>
            <p>A MerMEId 'source' is not a single physical object but a description of all objects
                carrying the same information in the same format: for instance, the printed first
                edition of a score is considered a source. The second edition is another source.
                This is probably the most difficult concept to comprehend when working with MerMEId
                (or, in general, the FRBR-enhanced variant of MEI).</p>
            <p>The terminological confusion arises from the fact that the original, simpler version
                of the MEI schema &ndash; without the FRBR enhancement &ndash; does not distinguish
                'item' and 'source' levels but only has 'source'. In simple MEI, 'source' can refer
                to either a printed edition (a print run) or a specific copy of that edition.
                MerMEId is more specific. By adding the 'item' level, the meaning of 'source' is
                restricted to general features shared (at least originally) by all copies of that
                source. The characteristics of individual copies are described at item level
                instead.</p>
            <p>Below is an illustration of a printed first edition (source) with two exemplars
                (items) located in Berlin and Copenhagen, respectivey.</p>
            <img alt="Source with items"
                src="../images/manual/structure_source_items.png"
                width="500" /><br />&nbsp; <p>As a consequence, library shelf marks cannot be
                entered at source level but only at item level since shelf marks can only refer to
                individual copies (exemplars). Conversely, the name of the publisher cannot be
                specified at item level because this information must apply to all copies of that
                particular edition and therefore should be entered at source level.</p>
            <p>The distinction between sources and items may seem particularly confusing when
                describing manuscript sources which obviously are unique. However, the same encoding
                pratice should be applied to manuscripts and prints to ensure the same
                functionality; thinking of manuscripts as printed sources with only one surviving
                copy may be helpful when deciding where to enter what information.</p>
            <p>To minimize redundancy no information given at source level should be 
                repeated at item level. 
                As a rule of thumb, we recommend putting information at the highest possible level. 
                For instance, the title page of a manuscript should be 
            cited at source level rather than at item level. The description of other features 
            like paper and watermark are more problematic and may depend on your project's guidelines.
            Some projects may consider photocopies, digitizations or microfilms of a manuscript to be
            items of the same source; others may regard them as distinct sources (FRBR "manifestations")
            or disregard them entirely.
            General recommendations are yet to be discussed.</p>
            <p>Sources and items are created at the <span class="source tab">Sources</span> tab. 
                If the work has more than one version, sources can be organized according to the 
                versions they embody (see also the tutorial: <a href="../manual/tutorial_versions.html"
                    title="Tutorial: Works having multiple versions">Works having multiple
                    version</a>).
            </p>
            <h3>Source components</h3>
            <p>Both sources and items can have components to be described indivdually. For example,
                a set of orchestral parts can be defined as a source with some shared features (such
                as plate number the publisher's name), but a description of each of the parts may be
                provided as well by creating source components. Components are added at the bottom
                of the source details editor page.</p>
            <img alt="Source components"
                src="../images/manual/structure_source_components.png"
                width="500" /><br />&nbsp; <p>Source components can also describe the contents of a
                source containing multiple works or movements:</p>
            <img alt="Source components"
                src="../images/manual/structure_source_components2.png"
                width="500" /><br />&nbsp; <h3>Item components</h3>
            <p> At item level, components are useful for describing the physical appearance or
                condition of the individual parts of a set, or the individual fascicles of a
                compound source. Item components also allow the description of a set of parts in
                which each part has its own shelf mark, or where parts have accidentally been
                scattered over a number of locations. </p>
            <img alt="Item components"
                src="../images/manual/structure_item_components.png"
                width="500" /><br />&nbsp; <p>Sometimes it will be sufficient to describe components
                at either source or item level (for example, if only a single copy is known or if
                other copies are not considered); sometimes you will want to use components at both
                levels &ndash; or neither. </p>
            <p>As source components can also have items, MerMEId can even describe complex
                situations where surviving item components (such as part books) scattered across a
                number of locations cannot be grouped into well-defined sets (items) but are better
                described as individual items:</p>
            <img alt="Source components with items"
                src="../images/manual/structure_source_components_with_items.png"
                width="500" /><br />&nbsp;             
            <h2>Historical information</h2>
            <p>Details about a work's history &ndash; its creation, reception, performances etc. &ndash; can be entered 
            at the <span class="history tab">History</span> tab. If more than one version of the work is defined 
            (by adding alternative versions at the <span class="music tab">Music</span> tab), historical information
            can be given at either work or version level. See also the tutorial: <a href="../manual/tutorial_versions.html"
                title="Tutorial: Works having multiple versions">Works having multiple
                version</a></p>
            <h2>Bibliographic references</h2>
            <p>The <span class="bibliography tab">Bibliography</span> tab allows the user to add a list of other material related 
                to the musical work but not regarded as sources to the work itself. This may include the composer's or others' letters, 
                diary entries, essays, and other (historical, biographical, analytic etc.) literature.</p>
            <p>References can be organized in any number of lists, each with a custom heading - for instance, 'Letters',
                'Documents', or 'Bibliography'.</p>
            
            <h2><a name="tech_adm_metadata">Technical and
                administrative metadata</a></h2>
            <p>In addition to the metadata about the musical work and sources, also information about 
                the file itself, its creators and the context in which it was created - somewhat like a book's imprint - 
                can be encoded with MerMEId. 
            </p>
            <p>These metadata include information about the persons, institutions, and software involved
            in the creation of the file. Also a project description and a note aboout use restrictions - such 
            as copyright or license information - may be given. </p>
            <p>Technical/adminsitrative metadata are edited at the <span class="file tab">File</span> tab.</p>
            <p>File metadata also include the name of the 'file collection' (usually the short name of the catalogue or project)
            which MerMEId uses to organize files into different catalogues/projects.</p>
