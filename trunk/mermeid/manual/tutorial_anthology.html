    <h3>How to...</h3>
    <h1>Create a music anthology</h1>
    <p>A distinction should be made between anthologies regarded as one work and anthologies regarded 
      as a collection of individual works.</p>
    <p><strong>Anthologies regarded as one work</strong>, e.g. certain song cycles,
      are simply works with a number of constituent components. These components are defined at the 
      <span class="music">Music</span> tab:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Near the bottom of the page, add the desired number of components.</li>
      <li>Save your work and start editing the components one at a time by clicking the component's edit button.</li>
      <li>Enter the details about the component, such as the title and the text author.</li>
      <li>Click the "save and close" button to save your work and return to the <span class="music">Music</span> tab.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Anthologies of individual works</strong> can be created as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, create and save the individual works. However, sources representing the entire anthology should not be defined 
        at this stage.</li>
      <li>Then, create another work to represent the anthology. At the <span class="work">Work</span> tab,
        start defining relations to the contained works by clicking the "Add relation" button.</li>
      <li>Select the "contains:" relation</li>
      <li>If you know the work's file name, you may enter it directly in the [target?] field.<br/>
        Otherwise, open the works browser by clicking the [link?] button. 
        In the works browser, locate and click the desired work. It may be helpful to 
        narrow the search to a specific file collection or enter search terms such as the title. 
        Please note that the file browser may need some time to update.<br/>
      </li>
      <li>Repeat this with each of the contained works and save your work.</li>
      <li>Add any other desired information about the anthology, such as title, source descriptions etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember that relations are bidirectional. In order to create links both ways (from the anthology to the individual works
      and back), edit each of the contained works to add a relation back to the anthology. 
      You have easy access to the contained works by using the "Go to..." button</p>
    <p>In the HTML preview, the reprint will be displayed after the original source:
