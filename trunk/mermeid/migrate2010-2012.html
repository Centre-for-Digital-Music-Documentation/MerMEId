    <h1>HOW TO migrate from MEI 2010 to 2012</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Assumptions:</strong> We take for granted that you store your
      documents in an eXist native XML database in a collection called dcm,
      and that you can do the migration on a linux computer where you have
      access to a shell prompt. You also need Michael Kay's eminent Saxon xslt
      processor (<a
      href="http://www.saxonica.com/welcome/welcome.xml">Saxonica</a>).
      You should be able to run that from comand line using a command called
      <kbd>saxon</kbd>.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Create an empty directory. Let's call it <kbd>migration/</kbd></li>

      <li>Make a backup of your collection using the recipe in the <a
      href="./INSTALL.html#backup_and_restore">INSTALL.html</a>. If you use
      the eXist admin GUI, you'll get a zip archive. When unpacked, your
      files will live in <kbd>migration/db/dcm/*xml</kbd></li>

      <li>copy the directory <kbd>MerMEId/mermeid/transforms/mei/utils</kbd>
      with all its content to your <kbd>migration/</kbd></li>

      <li>
	copy the <kbd>MerMEId/mermeid/transforms/mei/filter_put.xsl</kbd>
	transform to your <kbd>migration/</kbd> directory. When done you should
	have the following.
	<ul>
	  <li>db (your records should be in db/dcm)</li>

	  <li>utils, with a number of xsl scripts and a perl script called
	  <kbd>sequential_transformer</kbd></li>

	  <li>filter_put.xsl</li>
	</ul>

      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now you just run the migration using the command:</p>
    <pre>
      utils/sequential_transformer --directory db/
    </pre>

    <p>It takes some time, since there are four independent transforms to
    make. And there will be some warning messages because some scripts are XSL
    v2 and other v1, and saxon doesn't really like the latter. There will be
    some intermediate results having a numeric suffix.</p>

    <p>If you successfully reload the files having suffix *.xml into your
    database, then you've migrated from mei 2010 to 2012.</p>
