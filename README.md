MerMEId
=======

MerMEId is a system for the editing, handling, and (pre-)viewing of music
metadata, based on the the [Music Encoding
Initiative](http://www.music-encoding.org/) (MEI)  XML schema. 
As of April 2017 MerMEId supports MEI 3.0.0.

MerMEId is developed at the [Danish Centre for Music Editing](http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/index.html) (DCM) both for
the production of thematic catalogues of works and for organizing source- and
work-related information during the preparation of scholarly editions of
music.

MerMEId is used for the creation and maintenance of [Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works, CNW](http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw.html),
[Johann Adolph Scheibe. A Catalogue of His Works](http://www.kb.dk/dcm/schw.html), and
[J.P.E. Hartmann. A Thematic-Bibliographic Catalogue of His Works](http://www.kb.dk/dcm/hartw.html)
